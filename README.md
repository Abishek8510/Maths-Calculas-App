# Math Calculator App

## Overview

The Math Calculator App is a Tkinter-based Python application designed to perform various mathematical computations and visualizations. It supports calculating limits, integrals, derivatives, and plotting functions with their properties. This application is useful for students, educators, and anyone interested in exploring mathematical functions and their behaviors.

## Features

- **Limit Calculation:** Compute the limit of a function at a specified point.
- **Integration:** Perform definite and indefinite integrations of functions and plot the results.
- **Differentiation:** Compute and display the derivative of a function.
- **Function Plotting:** Plot functions with options to shade areas under curves and display function properties.
- **Properties Analysis:** Find and display x-intercepts, y-intercepts, asymptotes, extrema, and inflection points.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **SymPy** (for symbolic mathematics)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd repository
   ```
3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install sympy numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Select an Operation:**
   - **Limit:** Enter the function and the limit point to compute the limit of the function at that point.
   - **Integrate:** Choose between 'Definite' and 'Indefinite' integration. For definite integration, specify the range. For indefinite integration, the result will include a '+ C' constant.
   - **Differentiation:** Enter the function to compute its derivative.
   - **Instruction:** Provides instructions on how to use the app.

3. **Enter Function:**
   Enter the mathematical function you want to analyze in the provided input field.

4. **Compute and Plot:**
   - Click the respective button to compute the result.
   - The result will be displayed below the input fields, and the function will be plotted with relevant properties if applicable.

## Example

To compute the limit of \( \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) as \( x \) approaches 0:
1. Select 'Limit' from the operation menu.
2. Enter `sin(x)/x` in the function field.
3. Enter `0` in the limit point field.
4. Click "Compute Limit".

## Code Overview

- **Functions for Computation:** Includes functions for finding intercepts, asymptotes, extrema, and inflection points.
- **Plotting:** Uses Matplotlib to plot functions and shade areas under curves.
- **GUI Setup:** Created using Tkinter with options to select operations, input functions, and display results.
